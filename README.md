### Hello, world!

I love languages (the ones you execute with your tongue), so I have my way with words. I teach English, translate, copywrite and proofread. I design, but not for a living.

I'm learning how to code at **42.rio**! Soon there'll be plenty of green squares below to make me proud. 🤓

Thanks for your interest!
