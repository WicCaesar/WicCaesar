### Hello, world! 🌎🌏🌍

I love the languages we express with our tongues, now I'm trying to learn the ones executed by machines.<br>
I teach English, translate, copywrite and proofread.<br>
I design, but not for a living.<br>

I'm learning how to code at **42|RIO** and Harvard's **CS50**! Soon there'll be plenty of green squares below to make me proud. 🤓<br>
I'm interested in cyborgs, accessibility, language models, machine learning, IoT, generative design and user interfaces.<br>
I'm after work as a technical writer.<br>

Thanks for reading so far!<br>
