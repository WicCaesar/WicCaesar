### Hello, world! 🌎🌍🌏

I love the languages you can execute with your tongue, now I'm trying to learn the ones executed by machines.<br>
I teach English, translate, copywrite and proofread.<br>
I design, but not for a living.<br>

I'm learning how to code at **42|RIO** and Harvard's **CS50**! Soon there'll be plenty of green squares below to make me proud. 🤓<br>
I'm interested in accessibility and user interfaces.<br>

Thanks for reading so far!<br>
