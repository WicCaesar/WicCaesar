### Hello, world! 🌎🌍🌏

I love languages (the ones you execute with your tongue), so I have my way with words. I teach English, translate, copywrite and proofread.<br>
I design, but not for a living.

I'm learning how to code at **42.rio**! Soon there'll be plenty of green squares below to make me proud. 🤓
I'm interested in accessibility and user interfaces.

Thanks for reading so far!
