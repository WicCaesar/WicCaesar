### Hello, world! 🌎🌍🌏

I love the languages you can execute with your tongue, now I'm trying to learn the ones executed by machines.
I teach English, translate, copywrite and proofread.
I design, but not for a living.

I'm learning how to code at **42|RIO**! Soon there'll be plenty of green squares below to make me proud. 🤓
I'm interested in accessibility and user interfaces.

Thanks for reading so far!
